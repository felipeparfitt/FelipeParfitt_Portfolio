## [Project 1: Clustering Countries with Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/felipeparfitt/FelipeParfitt_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20projects/CountryData_Clustering/clustering-country-data-kaggle.ipynb)

- This is a kaggle dataset for clustering the Countries by using Unsupervised Learning for HELP International.
- The quality of the features was improved using normalization techniques. 
- K-means model and PCA were applyed to data solve the problem.
- By dividing the data into three clusters, it is possible to identify three groups of countries: those in green with good indices that do not require assistance (North America, Western Europe, and some parts of Oceania); those in yellow with moderate indices that may require assistance (South America, most of Asia, North and South Africa); and those in red with low indices that require assistance (Central Africa and some countries in the Middle East).
